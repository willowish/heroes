## NX

If you don't have NX installed globally you might have to use "yarn nx" or "npx nx" to execute commands in the workspace.
Run "yarn global add nx" or "npm install -g nx" to be able to execute command directly.


## Development server

Run `nx serve heroes` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Understand this workspace

Run `nx graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of the projects.

## Remote caching

Run `npx nx connect-to-nx-cloud` to enable [remote caching](https://nx.app) and make CI faster.
